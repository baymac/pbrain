description: Walk through vault/Clippings/ and move each clip into one of your chosen top-level vault folders (or any subpath underneath), renaming if needed. Asks upfront which dirs to use. Decides on its own when confident, asks when split.

Run this with the Bash tool first, then follow the INSTRUCTIONS block in its output:

```bash
bash "${PBRAIN_DEV_DIR:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/pbrain}}/commands/organize-clippings.sh"
```

## Morning sequence check (do this first)

Before sorting clippings, check the morning anchors. Use today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

1. If `$VAULT_DIR/life/daily-tracking/<TODAY>.md` does NOT exist → say "Heads up: today's `/journal` is empty. Want to fill it in first? Clears the head before anything else." Pause.
2. Else if `$VAULT_DIR/life/gratitude-journal/<TODAY>.md` does NOT exist → say "Heads up: today's gratitude entry is missing. Want to run `/gratitude-journal` first?" Pause.

Suggest once. If user says continue / skip / no, proceed. **If the injected USER PREFERENCES block (global or per-command) says to skip the journal/gratitude nudge, skip steps 1–2 entirely** — a standing preference always overrides a built-in nudge. Resolve `$VAULT_DIR` the same way `lib/vault.sh` does: `$PBRAIN_VAULT` → `~/.config/pbrain/vault` → default iCloud Obsidian path.
